## Licenses

Including a LICENSE file in your mod is a good way to let others know what they can and can't do with your mod.  Visit the [License-Templates](License-Templates) folder in this repository to find several common licenses and a guide to help you choose which one to use.

## Maintenance Permissions

It's strongly recommended that you include the file [MAINTENANCE.md](Maintenance-Template/MAINTENANCE.md) in the root directory of your repository to make it clear that maintenance updates are approved regardless of what license your mod is using.
