# GitHub Templates

## Licenses

Including a LICENSE file in your mod is a good way to let others know what they can and can't do with your mod.  Visit the [License-Templates](License-Templates) folder in this repository to find several common licenses and a guide to help you choose which one to use.

## Maintenance Permissions

It's strongly recommended that you include the file [MAINTENANCE.md](Maintenance-Template/MAINTENANCE.md) in the root directory of your repository to make it clear that maintenance updates are approved regardless of what license your mod is using.

## Badges

You can include badges at the top of the README file in your repo to quickly convey important information about your mod. You can see this in action on the [RealMod](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/RealMod) readme.

### License:

If GitHub is able to auto-detect your license, this badge can be used.  Unfortunately, there are a number of license types that GitHub does not detect correctly.  I believe it can identify CC-BY-4.0 and CC-BY-SA-4.0 and some popular software licenses.

Custom badges can display whatever information you want, such as which platforms your mod is compatible with.  You can visit [shields.io](https://shields.io/) to find additional badges and make your own custom badges.
